# igotify

A thin wrapper around *inotify* Linux syscalls and capabilities. Allows for easier interfacing with *inotify* through
usual Go patterns instead of directly using the *syscall* library.

See `examples/basic` for basic usage and tips on how to use the wrapper.

## How to use

`go get github.com/ffhan/igotify@v0.2.0`
